\title{Standardized Exchange Gini Index}
\usage{
  migration.gini.exchange.standardized(m,
    migration.gini.total = migration.gini.total(m))
}
\arguments{
  \item{m}{migration matrix}

  \item{migration.gini.total}{optionally pass the
  pre-computed Total Flows Gini Index to save resources}
}
\value{
  A percentage range from 0\% to 100\% where 0\% means that
  the migration flows are uniform, while a higher value
  indicates spatial focusing.
}
\description{
  The standardized version of the Exchange Gini Index
  (\code{\link{migration.gini.exchange}}) by dividing that
  with the Total Flows Gini Index
  (\code{\link{migration.gini.total}}): \deqn{G^{T*}_{RC,
  CR} = 100\frac{G^T_{RC, CR}}{G^T}} As this index is
  standardized, it "facilitate comparisons from one period
  to the next" of the exchange indices.

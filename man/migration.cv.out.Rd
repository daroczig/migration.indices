\title{Out-migration Coefficient of Variation}
\usage{
migration.cv.out(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{migration matrix}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of standardized values where a higher (\eqn{\neq 0}) shows more spatial focus.
}
\description{
As "the coefficient of variation is defined as the standard deviation to mean ratio of a distribution", the Out-migration Coefficient of Variation is computed by dividing the standard deviation (with the nominator being \eqn{n} instead of \eqn{n-1}) of the out-migration flows by the mean.

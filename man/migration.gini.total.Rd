\usage{
  migration.gini.total(m, corrected = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{m}{migration matrix}

  \item{corrected}{Bell et al. (2002) updated the formula
  of Plane and Mulligan (1997) to be \eqn{2{n(n-1)-1}}
  instead of \eqn{2n(n-1)} to "ensure that the index can
  assume the upper limit of 1".}
}
\value{
  A number between 0 and 1 where 0 means no spatial
  focusing and 1 shows that all migrants are found in one
  single flow.
}
\description{
  The Total Gini Index shows the overall concentration of
  migration with a simple number computed by comparing each
  cell of the migration matrix with every other cell except
  for the diagonal: \deqn{G^T = \frac{\sum_i \sum_{j \neq
  i} \sum_k \sum_{l \neq k} | M_{ij} - M_{kl} | }{
  (2n(n-1)-1) \sum_i \sum_{j \neq i} M_{ij}}} This
  implementation solves the above formula by a simple loop
  for performance issues to compare all values to the
  others at one go, although smaller migration matrices
  could also be addressed by a much faster \code{dist}
  method. Please see the sources for more details.
